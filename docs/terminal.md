# What is a Terminal Session?

A **terminal session** is a way to interact with your computer using text commands instead of a mouse or graphical interface. Think of it as a conversation between you and your computer, where you type instructions, and the computer responds with text-based output.

## Breaking It Down

- **The Terminal:** This is a program that gives you access to the command-line interface (CLI). On macOS, common terminals include **Terminal.app**, **iTerm2**, and others.
- **The Shell:** When you open a terminal, you're actually using a program called a **shell** (like Bash or Zsh). The shell is what interprets the commands you type.
- **A Session:** A terminal session starts when you open a terminal window and ends when you close it. During this session, you can run commands, execute scripts, and manage files.

## Why Use a Terminal?

Most people interact with their computers using graphical user interfaces (GUIs), but developers and power users prefer the terminal because it allows for:

- **More control** over system operations.
- **Automation** through scripts and commands.
- **Faster navigation** for managing files and applications.

A terminal session is like having a direct line to your computer's brain, allowing you to do things more efficientlyâ€”if you know the right commands.
