# What is Oat?

Oat is an application that helps users manage their terminal environment on macOS. It provides both a **graphical user interface (GUI)** and a **command-line interface (CLI)** to easily add, edit, and organize **aliases, functions, variables, and the PATH** in shell configuration files.

## Why Does Oat Exist?

For many developers, customizing the terminal involves manually editing configuration files like `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`. This can be confusing and error-prone, especially for beginners. Oat simplifies this process by:

- Providing a **user-friendly interface** to manage these files.
- Making changes **transparent** so users always know whatâ€™s being modified.
- Allowing quick updates without having to manually edit system files.

## Who is Oat For?

Oat is designed for **both novice and experienced developers**:

- **Novices** get a simple way to customize their terminal without worrying about breaking things.
- **Experienced users** benefit from a faster, more organized way to manage their configurations.

## Key Features

- **Manage Aliases:** Create shortcuts for long terminal commands.
- **Define Variables:** Set custom environment variables without editing files manually.
- **Edit Functions:** Add reusable functions to automate tasks.
- **Modify PATH:** Control which directories are available for command execution.
- **Plugin System (Future Feature):** Extend Oat with community-created functionality.

Oat ensures that users maintain **full visibility and control** over their terminal configuration while making customization much easier.
